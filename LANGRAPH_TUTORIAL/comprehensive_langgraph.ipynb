        "\n",
        "**LangGraph** is a library for building **stateful, multi-actor applications** with LLMs. It extends LangChain with the ability to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a **cyclic** manner.\n",

        "- 📊 **Built-in observability** with LangSmith\n",

        "\n",
        "### 🔑 Core Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **State** \n",
        "- The \"memory\" of your application\n",
        "- Shared data structure that persists across all steps\n",
        "- Can contain messages, variables, flags, or any data you need\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Nodes**\n",
        "- Individual functions or operations in your workflow\n",
        "- Each node receives the current state and returns updates\n",
        "- Think of them as \"workers\" that do specific tasks\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Edges** \n",
        "- Connections between nodes that define the flow\n",
        "- Can be simple (A → B) or conditional (A → B or C based on logic)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Graph**\n",
        "- The complete workflow combining nodes and edges\n",
        "- Defines how your AI agent behaves and makes decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Simple Mental Model\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of LangGraph like a **flowchart for AI agents**:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "[User Input] → [AI Thinks] → [Uses Tool?] \n",
        "                    ↓              ↓\n",
        "               [Respond]      [Call Tool] → [AI Thinks] → [Respond]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "But unlike a simple flowchart, LangGraph can:\n",
        "- Remember everything that happened before\n",
        "- Loop back to previous steps\n",
        "- Involve humans in the decision-making\n",
        "- Handle complex, branching logic\n",
